(Work in progress) I'm teaching myself how to work with Express for this project.
Creating a full stack web application that allows the user to track errors they find while programming. Each item in the list includes a checkbox for resolving the error, an image of the programming language used, the type of error, and if itâ€™s a warning or not.
Utilized React Router to add multiple pages for adding errors and also for viewing the full list of errors.
Pulled errors inserted by the user from the Express backend to refresh the state on the frontend every time an error is added.
